      <strong>Hello World!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are excited to present our final project for <strong>CS50</strong>, a web application called IMS,
      which stands for Inventory Management Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      IMS is a web application written in Python with the Flask framework.
      It features authentication and management systems.
      The functionality of the authentication system includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Registering a new user.</li>
      <li>Logging in and out of the system.</li>
      <li>Changing your username and password.</li>
      <li>Setting up two-factor authentication.</li>
      <li>Recovering your account if you forget your password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, the software includes a set of functionalities that allow users to configure
      and initialize a management system based on cost center. Users can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create items and products.</li>
      <li>Store supplier information.</li>
      <li>Add new suppliers.</li>
      <li>Register new purchases.</li>
      <li>Register sales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application enables management of raw materials, components, and finished products, as well
      as evaluation of an elementary financial state of business performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front-end was written with a minimal CSS framework called Pico CSS which helped us to create
      a consistent visual language across the application. This allowed us to focus primarily on developing
      the back-end of the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are really proud of the work that we have done on IMS and we hope that you find it useful.
    </p>

      <strong>And this was CS50!</strong>
